 - renamed 'results_models' directory to just 'models'
 - deleted the run_05_batches model directory
 - renamed the run_50_batches model directory to 'model_01'
 - reworked zernike_predictor.py so that the relative amplitudes of
   the three maps are preserved while z=0 maps gets amplitude=1.

4/8/2025
 - stopped and deleted a2000+a1100 model
 - reworked data training with a few key changes:
   - got rid of the two tilts since they are primarily pointing offsets
   - added synthetic data generation for the basis vectors
     - delta functions at each basis vector with about 7 different amplitudes
     - pairs of basis vectors - focussing on astigmatism and coma
 - deleted all 50m data and models
 - deleted older 45m data and models
 - started a new synthetic data run with 1-100, 101-200, and 201-300 + basis vectors


4/7/2025
 - evaluation of 45m data is complete
 - moved model directory to results_model_45/run_20250405-a2000
 - started training same data but for model a2000+a1100

4/6/2025
 - built 'basis_vectors' test where we test model with +/- 100 micron
   amplitudes on each zernike parameter
 - results are not very good - model wants to put power in all modes and
   so undercounts actual mode
 - neeed to develop mitigation strategy

4/5/2025
 - started model training on 45m data even though it's not quite done yet

4/4/2025
 - all steps for 45m data
   - modified LMTOOF to use 45m dish for TolTEC bands
   - synthetic data generation is ongoing in data/synthetic_45m

4/3/2025
 - all steps for the 50m data
   - synthetic data generation in data/synthetic_50m
   - model generated from 2mm data only
   - model evaluation pdf created
   - model comparison with all existing TolTEC OOF data is complete
   - initial comparison with Pete's outputs show much smaller zernike coefficient estimations
